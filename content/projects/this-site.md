summary: "This site made with Hugo"
---

The first project writeup on [this site]() is about the site itself!

## Making

I made this site with the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

I am using a custom theme made in html with hugo templates. The content on the site is written in markdown which gets injected into the templates at buildtime and outputs a static html site.

## Hosting

It is, as of writing this, hosted on github pages. It is automatically built with github actions which was provided on the hugo [website](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/).
