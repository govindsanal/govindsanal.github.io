summary: "This site made with Hugo"
---

The first project writeup on [this site](/projects/this-site) is about the site itself!

## Making

I made this site with the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

I am using a custom theme made in html with hugo templates. The content on the site is written in markdown which gets injected into the templates at buildtime and outputs a static html site.

## Hosting

It is hosted on github pages, which automatically builds the page, through github actions when a commit is pushed to the github [repo](https://github.com/govindsanal/govind-sanal).
